## The Union Budget 2026 Masterstroke (Spike in Profit)
While refining my intraday strategies and psychology throughout 2025, I identified the Union Budget as a once-in-a-year high-conviction event.  

Drawing from my 2024-25 experience (where I lost a few thousand), I spent **three dedicated months** preparing:
- Word-by-word analysis of the last 5–6 budget speeches
- Mapping market expectations vs actual outcomes
- Backtesting every possible setup I would have taken in prior years
- Trading the pre-budget rally with precision

**Result**: I captured the **entire ₹1,20,872 net profit in under one hour** during the 2026 Budget speech. My preparation was so thorough that the exact announcements almost didn’t matter — the edge was already locked in.

## Self-Taught Discipline & Market Grit
After years of being humbled by the market, I built unbreakable emotional control and iron-clad discipline.  
Every strategy, risk rule, and psychological framework I use is 100% self-taught through relentless iteration and real-money feedback.  
This battle-tested resilience and execution consistency is something no textbook or fresh finance graduate can replicate.
