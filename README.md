### Union Budget 2026 – The Defining Trade
Recognising the Union Budget as a high-conviction opportunity, I dedicated three months to intensive preparation while simultaneously refining my intraday strategies. Drawing on my 2024-25 budget experience, I analysed every word of the previous 5–6 budgets, mapped market expectations versus reality, and backtested every potential setup.  

This preparation enabled me to generate the **entire ₹1,20,290 net profit in under one hour** during the 2026 Budget speech. The depth of analysis was such that the exact announcements were almost secondary — the edge was already built in.

### Trader Discipline & Self-Taught Resilience
After years of direct market feedback, I have developed unbreakable emotional discipline and resistance to psychological pressure. Every aspect of my trading — strategy development, risk rules, and execution — has been self-taught through relentless iteration. This real-world grit and battle-tested consistency is rare among finance graduates and gives me a clear edge in high-stakes environments.
